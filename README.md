# welcome-to-fairy-tale-world

PERSONAL INTENTION: Most of my childhood memory has little to do with fairy tales. And I believe most college students experience "mom telling stories" before going to sleep when they were children. Basically we receive the information via listening, so I want to construct a more vivid and diverse environment for kids to explore in the digital fairy tale world.

DESIGN PURPOSE: Digitalize fairy tales and provide an interactive environment for kids so that they can experience the fairy tales. Allow kids to construct their own stories by drawing charaters, moving around the personas, typing in texts, recording audios.

INTENDED AUDIENCE: All children who want to experience the digital fairy tales as well as create their own stories.
